You can then proceed by choosing your preferred user interface below.

## Choose your interface

Choose your preferred interface for working with the Aignostics Platform. Each interface is designed for different user roles and use cases:

### How analysis works

Whether you use the Launchpad, CLI, or Python Library, the analysis workflow follows the same pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["📂 Select Slides"] --> B["🔬 Choose Application"]
    B --> C["📤 Submit Run"]
    C --> D["⏳ Processing"]
    D --> E["📥 Download Results"]
    E --> F["🔍 Inspect & Analyze"]

    style A fill:#e8f4f8,stroke:#0077b6
    style B fill:#e8f4f8,stroke:#0077b6
    style C fill:#d4edda,stroke:#28a745
    style D fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#ffc107
    style E fill:#d4edda,stroke:#28a745
    style F fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#9c27b0
```

You start by selecting the whole slide images you want to analyze, then choose an application (like Atlas H&E-TME) and submit your run. The Aignostics Platform processes your slides in the cloud, and you download the results when ready. Each interface offers the same capabilities—choose the one that fits your workflow.

2. The system automatically creates a QuPath project with your slides and annotations loaded
3. In QuPath, you can:
   - View tissue and cell annotations overlaid on your slides
   - Explore cell classifications and measurements
   - Analyze spatial relationships between different cell types
   - Export annotations or perform additional analysis

**Congratulations!** You have successfully downloaded a public dataset, submitted an Atlas H&E-TME analysis run, and learned how to access and inspect your results.

### Advanced Setup: Extensions

> 💡 The Launchpad features a growing ecosystem of extensions that seamlessly integrate with standard digital pathology tools. To use the Launchpad with all available extensions, run `uvx --from "aignostics[qupath,marimo]" aignostics launchpad`. Currently available extensions are:
>
> 1. **QuPath extension**: View your application results in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) with a single click. The Launchpad creates QuPath projects on-the-fly.
> 2. **Marimo extension**: Analyze your application results using [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks embedded in the Launchpad. You don't have to leave the Launchpad to do real data science.

## CLI: Manage datasets and application runs from your terminal

The Python SDK includes the **Aignostics CLI**, a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to
interact with the Aignostics Platform directly from your terminal or shell script.

**New to CLI?** See <a href="#installation">Installation</a> section above to get started.

**Common workflows:**

- Download public datasets from NCI Image Data Commons
- Submit batch processing runs for multiple slides
- Monitor run status and download results incrementally
- Automate repetitive tasks with shell scripts

See as follows for a simple example where we download a sample dataset for the [Atlas
H&E-TME application](https://www.aignostics.com/products/he-tme-profiling-product), submit an application run, and download the results.

### Example: Running Atlas H&E-TME with CLI

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Use the following commands to run the Atlas H&E-TME application on a sample dataset:

```shell
# Download a sample dataset from the NCI Image Data Commons (IDC) portal to your current working directory
# As the dataset id refers to the TCGA LUAD collection, this creates a directory tcga_luad with the DICOM files
uvx aignostics dataset idc download 1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.1069745200.1645485340.1637452317744.2.0 data/
# Prepare the metadata for the application run by creating a metadata.csv, extracting 
# the required metadata from the DICOM files. We furthermore add the required
# information about the tissue type and disease.
uvx aignostics application run prepare he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv data/
# Edit the metadata.csv to insert the required information about the staining method, tissue type and disease
# Adapt to your favourite editor
nano tcga_luad/metadata.csv 
# Upload the metadata.csv and referenced whole slide images to the Aignostics Platform
uvx aignostics application run upload he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv
# Submit the application run and print the run id
uvx aignostics application run submit he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv
# Check the status of the application run you submitted
uvx aignostics application run list
# Incrementally download results when they become available
# Fill in the id from the output in the previous step
uvx aignostics application run result download APPLICATION_RUN_ID 
```

For convenience the `application run execute` command combines preparation, upload, submission and download.
The below is equivalent to the above, while adding additionally required metadata using a mapping:

```shell
uvx aignostics dataset idc download 1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.1069745200.1645485340.1637452317744.2.0 data/
uvx aignostics application run execute he-tme data/tcga_luad/run.csv data/ --mapping ".*\.dcm:staining_method=H&E,tissue=LUNG,disease=LUNG_CANCER"
```

The CLI provides extensive help:

```shell
uvx aignostics --help                           # list all spaces such as application, dataset, bucket and system, 
uvx aignostics application --help               # list subcommands in the application space
uvx aignostics application run --help           # list subcommands in the application run sub-space
uvx aignostics application run list --help      # show help for specific command
uvx aignostics application run execute --help   # show help for another command
```

```

Please look at the notebooks in the `example` folder for a more detailed example
and read the
[client reference documentation](https://aignostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lib_reference.html)
to learn about all classes and methods.

### Example Notebooks: Interact with the Aignostics Platform from your Python Notebook environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you get started, you need to set up your authentication credentials if
> you did not yet do so! Please visit
> [your personal dashboard on the Aignostics Platform website](https://platform.aignostics.com/getting-started/quick-start)
> and follow the steps outlined in the `Use in Python Notebooks` section.

The Python SDK includes ready-to-use Marimo notebooks that demonstrate platform interaction patterns. These notebooks are ideal for:

> Run you want to inspect in the left sidebar, and click the button "Open in Python Notebook".

### Defining the input for an application run

The following sections provide technical details for advanced use cases. These examples use the "Test Application" - a free application available to all users for testing and development purposes.

When creating an application run, you need to specify the `application_id` and optionally the
`application_version` (version number) of the application you want to run. If you omit the version,
the latest version will be used automatically. Additionally, you need to define the input items you
want to process in the run. The input items are defined as follows:

```python
platform.InputItem(
    external_id="1",
    input_artifacts=[
        platform.InputArtifact(
            name="whole_slide_image", # defined by the application version's input artifact schema
            download_url="<a signed url to download the data>",
            metadata={ # defined by the application version's input artifact schema
                "checksum_base64_crc32c": "N+LWCg==",
                "resolution_mpp": 0.46499982,
                "width_px": 3728,
                "height_px": 3640,
            },
        )
    ],
),
```

For each item you want to process, you need to provide a unique `reference`
string. This is used to identify the item in the results later on. The
`input_artifacts` field is a list of `InputArtifact` objects, which defines what
data & metadata you need to provide for each item. The required artifacts depend
on the application version you want to run - in the case of test application,
there is only one artifact required, which is the image to process on. The
artifact name is defined as `whole_slide_image` for this application.

The `download_url` is a signed URL that allows the Aignostics Platform to
download the image data later during processing.

### Self-signed URLs for large files

To make the whole slide images you want to process available to the Aignostics Platform, you
need to provide a signed URL that allows the platform to download the data.
Self-signed URLs for files in google storage buckets can be generated using the
`generate_signed_url`
([code](https://github.com/aignostics/python-sdk/blob/407e74f7ae89289b70efd86cbda59ec7414050d5/src/aignostics/client/utils.py#L85)).

**We expect that you provide the
[required credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)
for the Google Storage Bucket**
